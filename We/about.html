            <p>The Green Bean was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate green bean enthusiasts who wanted to create a community to share their love of this incredible legume.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Educate people about the nutritional benefits and culinary versatility of green beans</li>
                <li>Showcase exceptional green bean dishes and the people who create them</li>
                <li>Advocate for greater appreciation and consumption of green beans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe that green beans are an underappreciated wonder of the vegetable world, and we're on a mission to change that. Whether you're a longtime green bean devotee or just discovering their charms, we welcome you to join our community.</p>
